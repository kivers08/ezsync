# Authentication (shared)

Shared by every `xcloud-*` domain skill. The xCloud Public API authenticates via
[Sanctum personal access tokens](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum) (Bearer auth).

## Environment variables

```bash
export XCLOUD_API_TOKEN="..."                         # required
export XCLOUD_API_BASE_URL="https://app.xcloud.host"  # default (live)
# Local development:
export XCLOUD_API_BASE_URL="http://xcloud.test"
```

The base URL is the **only** thing that changes between local and live — never
hardcode a host in a skill body.

## Setting the token (Claude Code / CLI)

**Step 1 — generate the token first.** In the xCloud dashboard:
**Profile → API Tokens → Generate New Token** → choose the scopes you need (e.g.
`read:servers`) → copy it immediately (shown only once). Always tell the user to
create the token *before* the storage steps below.

**Step 2 — store it.** The token must live in the **environment Claude Code uses
for the Bash tool**. The reliable, persistent way is the user `settings.json` —
guide the user through this exact path:

**Recommended — `~/.claude/settings.json`** (loads on every session):

1. Open the file (exact path `~/.claude/settings.json`, i.e.
   `/Users/<you>/.claude/settings.json`). For example:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```
2. Add an `env` block with the token (and optionally the base URL). If the file
   is empty, paste the whole object; if it already has keys, add `env` alongside
   them — don't duplicate the outer braces:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "XCLOUD_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here",
       "XCLOUD_API_BASE_URL": "https://app.xcloud.host"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save, then **restart Claude Code** (quit + reopen) so the new env is applied.

**Do NOT tell the user to run `! export XCLOUD_API_TOKEN=…` in the prompt** — that
executes in a throwaway subshell and does **not** persist to the next Bash call,
so the very next request still sees no token. Always direct them to
`settings.json`.

Alternative — shell profile (only affects terminals the user launches manually):
```bash
echo "export XCLOUD_API_TOKEN='your-token-here'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

> **claude.ai app:** there is no `settings.json`. Ask the user to paste the token
> in the conversation; Claude exports it for that session only.

## Generating a token

xCloud dashboard → **Profile → API Tokens → Generate New Token** → choose scopes
→ copy immediately (shown once).

## Scopes (Sanctum abilities)

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `read:sites` | All `GET` under `/sites/*` and `/ssl-certificates/*` |
| `write:sites` | All write methods under `/sites/*` |
| `read:servers` | All `GET` under `/servers/*` |
| `write:servers` | All write methods under `/servers/*` |
| `*` | Full access (incl. token management) |

## Fine-grained authorization

Scopes are coarse; each request also passes a per-resource policy check. A `403`
with a valid token means the user lacks a required team permission (e.g.
`site:manage-ssl` for SSL renewal), not that the token is wrong.

## Verifying auth

```bash
scripts/xcloud.sh GET /user
```

`401` → token missing/expired/revoked. `403` → scope or team-permission gap.
